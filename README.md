# Overview

This project's goal was to expand my knowledge and skills in multiple languages. This showcases my current learning of Kotlin

This Kotlin project is a basic calculator that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also can print the calculator history so the user may see what calculations they have done during the app session.

My purpose in writing this program was to deepen my knowledge of variables, conditionals, functions, classes, loops, and data classes, all within the Kotlin language.

# Development Environment

This program uses IntelliJ IDEA as the development environment.

The program consists solely of the Kotlin programming language. 

# Useful Websites

I used 2 main websites during this program's development.

- [Programiz.com](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/hello-world)
- [Kotlinlang.org](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html)

# Future Work

Items to add to the program in the future:

- Input validation for numbers to be calculated.
- Ability to use multiple operands in single calculation
- Ability to perform more functions (i.e. square root, negative numbers, etc).
